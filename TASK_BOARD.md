# Task Board

This file is for active and upcoming work that an AI coding agent can actually implement in the repository.

If a task mainly requires Kwame to make a decision, record a video, choose branding, decide pricing, or do other non-coding launch work, it belongs in `docs/human-launch-checklist.md` instead.

If a task is a future product idea and not ready to build yet, it belongs in `docs/future-roadmap.md`.

If a task is engineering hardening, reliability, security, performance, architecture, or data-integrity work, it belongs in `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md` until it becomes active.

Completed work should be summarized in `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`, `TESTING.md`, commit history, and PR/issue history. Do not let this board become a giant archive of everything that ever happened.

## Required Reading Before Starting

Before touching code, read:

1. `MASTER_BRIEF.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
4. `DECISION_LOG.md`
5. `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`
6. `TASK_BOARD.md`
7. `TESTING.md`

Also read the relevant roadmap file when the task points there:

- `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md` for engineering debt and hardening
- `docs/future-roadmap.md` for future product ideas
- `docs/human-launch-checklist.md` for human launch decisions and launch chores

## Pre-Task Check — Required Before Starting Any Task

Every AI agent must run this check before beginning any task from `Now`, `Next`, or `Later`.

The goal is to prevent re-doing work that was already completed or partially completed in a previous session.

### Step 1 — Check continuity files

For the task you are about to start, look for evidence in:

- `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` under recent `What was completed` sections
- `TESTING.md` for `Passed`, `Needs retest`, `Failed`, or dated entries
- `DECISION_LOG.md` for locked decisions that affect the task
- `MASTER_BRIEF.md` and `AGENTS.md` for workflow rules
- Recent git history, especially `git log --oneline -20`
- Relevant source files that may already contain partial implementation

### Step 2 — Decide before editing

| What you found | What to do |
|---|---|
| No evidence of prior work | Proceed with the task normally. |
| Partial implementation found | Stop and audit. Summarize what exists and ask Kwame whether to complete, revert, or leave it. |
| Full implementation found but test status is `Needs retest` | Do not re-implement. Report that browser/manual validation is the remaining step. |
| Full implementation found and test status is `Passed` | Task is done. Do not reopen it. |
| Ambiguous evidence | Stop and audit first. Give a confidence level before recommending next action. |

### Step 3 — Report before coding

Before writing code, state:

- Which task you are starting
- What you found in the continuity files
- Whether you are proceeding or stopping for audit
- If proceeding, your plan in 3-5 practical steps

## Now

### 1. Continue typography and contrast audit beyond AI Partner

Done this session: Feedback page dropdowns, AI Partner SanctuarySelect + AiHelperPanel, Manuscript View panel (desktop + mobile), Scene Assets Panel, SaveAiResponseModal, Notification detail page + layout.

Continue auditing remaining pages with hardcoded light backgrounds (library, admin, settings, stats, new-project).

Focus on readability and theme consistency, especially Sanctuary and Midnight.

Do not redesign whole screens unless a focused contrast/readability fix requires it.

### 2. Check and fix export issues, starting with PDF

Audit and fix export problems, starting with PDF output and then verifying other export formats.

Pay special attention to screenplay-mode export errors and format parity across:

- PDF
- DOCX
- EPUB
- HTML
- Markdown
- Plain text

Before changing export code, check `TESTING.md`, `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`, and `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md` for known export-related issues.

## Not Here Anymore

The following types of items were intentionally moved out of this file:

- Human decisions and launch chores -> `docs/human-launch-checklist.md`
- Future product ideas -> `docs/future-roadmap.md`
- Engineering debt details -> `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md`
- Durable locked decisions -> `DECISION_LOG.md`
- Long completed-work history -> `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`, `TESTING.md`, commit history, and GitHub issues/PRs

This keeps `TASK_BOARD.md` usable as a real working board instead of a warehouse with fluorescent lights and forgotten boxes.
