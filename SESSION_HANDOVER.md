## 2026-04-26 - AI mode consolidation and structure-selection context fixes

### Current branch

`main`

### What was completed

- Merged quick writing ideas into the main AI mode selector and removed visible prompt injection for those modes.
- Kept quick writing steering internal so users can type their own prompt text while still using the selected AI mode.
- Extended screenplay-mode AI insert behavior so non-chat screenplay responses try to insert as structured screenplay blocks, not just plain text.
- Removed Archive Context from the AI Partner so saved AI responses now live only in AI Memory, not as inline request context controls.
- Trimmed excess desktop spacing in the AI Partner header and input footer.
- Removed the redundant static `Mode` pill so the dropdown selector stands on its own.
- Fixed the desktop structure tree checkbox collapse bug on act rows.
- Reworked story-context selection so explicit AI selection is separate from derived tree checkbox visuals.
- Fixed act/scene selection roll-up behavior so:
  - selecting an act covers its scenes for AI,
  - selecting all scenes rolls the act up visually,
  - deselecting a child scene breaks the act back into explicit scene selections,
  - reselecting the missing scene collapses the explicit selection back to the act,
  - clicking a rolled-up act can still deselect child coverage correctly.

### Current status

AI mode selection is consolidated, the AI Partner header is leaner, AI Memory is no longer duplicated as Archive Context inside the panel, screenplay insertion is more consistent for screenplay projects, and structure-tree selection now behaves consistently between the tree, AI-ready bar, and AI Partner context.

### Next recommended step

Run an in-browser regression pass on story context selection and screenplay AI insertion:
- single-scene selection,
- full-act selection,
- deselect/reselect one scene under an act,
- AI-ready chip collapse/expand,
- insert generated screenplay output into the editor from non-chat modes.

### Risks or warnings

- `components/project/story/AiHelperPanel.tsx`, `components/project/story/StoryTab.tsx`, and `components/project/story/StructureTree.tsx` contain the current uncommitted code changes.
- Focused eslint checks passed on `StoryTab.tsx` and `StructureTree.tsx`; `AiHelperPanel.tsx` still has a broader pre-existing lint backlog if run without narrowed rules.
- The screenplay insertion parser for non-chat modes is heuristic when the model does not return JSON, so real UI verification is still important.

## 2026-04-26 - AI partner mode selector changed to dropdown

### Current branch

`main`

### What was completed

- Replaced the AI partner horizontal mode button scroller with a single selectable dropdown.
- Kept the existing AI mode options and `promptMode` behavior.
- User confirmed the issue is resolved.

### Current status

The AI partner mode control now shows the current mode and opens a list of available modes when clicked.

### Next recommended step

Continue with the selected high-priority technical debt item when ready; recommended first candidate remains centralized rate limiting for AI routes.

### Risks or warnings

- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` passed.
- `npm run lint` still fails on existing repo-wide lint issues unrelated to this change.

## 2026-04-26 - Technical debt roadmap summarized into root continuity files

### Current branch

`main`

### What was completed

- Reviewed `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md`.
- Kept the original roadmap in `docs/` as the detailed source.
- Added a concise technical debt priority summary to `MASTER_BRIEF.md`.
- Added actionable technical debt items to `TASK_BOARD.md`.
- Added a decision log entry explaining why the docs roadmap was summarized rather than moved or deleted.

### Current status

The root continuity files now point agents toward the main reliability and technical debt priorities without duplicating the full roadmap.

### Next recommended step

Choose which high-priority technical debt item should be tackled first. Recommended first candidate: centralized rate limiting for AI routes, because it protects against API abuse and unexpected sponsored AI spend.

### Risks or warnings

- `docs/technical-debt-roadmap.md` remains the detailed source for implementation guidance.
- Do not begin database/RPC or billing/trial changes without a focused plan and careful testing.
- Keep root continuity files concise; use `docs/` for deeper technical plans.

## 2026-04-26 - Project continuity system added

### Current branch

`main`

### What was completed

- Added a root-level project continuity system.
- Added `MASTER_BRIEF.md` as the stable source of truth.
- Added `DECISION_LOG.md` for project decisions and reasons.
- Added `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` for session-to-session continuity.
- Added `TASK_BOARD.md` for simple Now / Next / Later / Done tracking.

### Current status

The repository now has the basic files needed for agents to catch up across machines and chat sessions.

### Next recommended step

Use the session start prompt from `MASTER_BRIEF.md` at the beginning of the next Codex, AG, Claude, or ChatGPT coding session.

### Risks or warnings

- These files are only useful if agents are instructed to read and update them.
- Do not let agents rewrite these files aggressively; updates should be concise and additive.
- More detailed product decisions still need to be added over time.
